Machine Learning Fundamentals

- **Gradient descent**

  - is a method to optimize your linear models.

- **Multiple Linear Regression**

  - is a technique for when you are comparing more than two variables.

- **Polynomial Regression**

  - is for relationships between variables that aren't linear.

- **Regularization**

  - is a technique to assure that your models will not only fit to the data available, but also extend to new situations.

- **Regression Problem**
  - predicting quantitative values. Predicting quantitative values is often just considered a Regression problem.
